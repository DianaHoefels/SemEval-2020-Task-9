The SentiMix task - predict the sentiment of a given code-mixed tweet. The sentiment labels are positive, negative, or neutral, and the code-mixed languages were English-Hindi and English-Spanish. Besides the sentiment labels, language labels at the word level were provided. The word-level language tags were en (English), spa (Spanish), hi (Hindi), mixed, and univ (e.g., symbols, @ mentions, hashtags). Efficiency was measured in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-measure. 
We yielded a weighted F1-score of 0.685, and we placed 25th.
