# SemEval-2020-Task-9
The SentiMix task - A summary 
The task is to predict the sentiment of a given code-mixed tweet. The sentiment labels are positive, negative, or neutral, and the code-mixed languages will be English-Hindi and English-Spanish. Besides the sentiment labels, we will also provide the language labels at the word level. The word-level language tags are en (English), spa (Spanish), hi (Hindi), mixed, and univ (e.g., symbols, @ mentions, hashtags).   Efficiency will be measured in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-measure.
